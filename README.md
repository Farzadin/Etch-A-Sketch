# Etch-A-Sketch

In this project I'll create browser version of something between a sketchpad and an Etch-A-Sketch

## Explanations

This project was part of Odin project [Foundations Course](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations).

The goal of this project was to put my DOM Manipulation skills on a test,
So that is why I didn't use html for the most part, because It was part of the
constrains of the project to create and manipulating html elements by only
using JavaScript.

### Styling

the styling of the Webpage was optional: I do not have enough skills to create
good and responsive design yet, and also my css file is super chaotic so I'm
sorry for anyone's eyes who is going to check that file.
